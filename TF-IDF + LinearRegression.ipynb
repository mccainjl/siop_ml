    "This approach uses no engineered features, and exclusively bases the regression model on the presence or absence of certain words in the respondent's answer to a particular question.  We are not considering other responses, meaning this model is attempting to predict one trait from a single response.  In a final product, we would leverage all of the responses for determining traits.\n",
